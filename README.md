# EzPlot
Simple plotting program with the matplotlib library.

You can download the installer and the program folder under Releases.

Python (3.10) is required to use EzPlot.
You can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installing python with the downloaded installer from the website above you can use EzPlot.

If you install EzPlot with the "EzPlot Installer" windows will pop up a security warning. 
This is because of a missing license and is no security threat.
However the installer is not needed, all program files are in the EzPlot folder which can be downloaded as EzPlot.zip.

I am not actively working on the project and I did not test it well, so there may be a lot of bugs.
